Learning and doing the basics of Socket.io for now.

[Demo running here](https://socket-1920.herokuapp.com/)

## Commands

`!help` or `/help` will redirect you here.  
`!play dQw4w9WgXcQ` or `/play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ` will play the video.

Play will also accept just the ID, youtu.be, and many more.

## TODO/Wishlist

- [x] Playing the same video to all connected users
- [ ] Pause/Play
- [ ] Scrubbing/moving to certain time
- [ ] Local mute button
- [ ] Playing the exact video at the exact moment even when joining late
- [x] Better regex for YouTube urls/ids
